Neural network is machine learning technique that try to mimic the working of neuron in
human brain for learning. At first it is unstable and after certain iteration of data it adjust
itself such that it’s accuracy increases. Although neural networks are widely known for use
in deep learning and modeling complex problems such as image recognition, they are easily
adapted to regression problems. Neural network regression is suited to problems where a
more traditional regression model cannot fit a solution.
