Neural network is machine learning technique that try to mimic the working of neuron in
human brain for learning. At first it is unstable and after certain iteration of data it adjust
itself such that it’s accuracy increases. Although neural networks are widely known for use
in deep learning and modeling complex problems such as image recognition, they are easily
adapted to regression problems. Neural network regression is suited to problems where a
more traditional regression model cannot fit a solution.

Jones Industrial Average data to predict close value of stock. <br>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), is a stock market index that shows how 30 large, publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. The value of the Dow is not a weighted arithmetic mean and does not represent its component companies' market capitalization, but rather the sum of the price of one share of stock for each component company. The sum is corrected by a factor which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index.<br>

It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, created by Wall Street Journal editor and Dow Jones & Company co-founder Charles Dow. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the best known of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was originally published on February 16, 1885.<br>
